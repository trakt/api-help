At Trakt, we collect lots of interesting information about what tv shows and movies everyone is watching. Part of the fun with such data is making it available for anyone to mash up and use on their own apps. The **Trakt API** was made just for this purpose. Let us know what you create!

## API Documentation
Check out the [**Trakt API docs**](https://trakt.docs.apiary.io/) which has everything you need to get started. 

## Questions & Bugs
API questions and bugs should be posted in the [**GitHub Issues**](https://github.com/trakt/api-help/issues) section. We previously used [**Google+**](https://plus.google.com/communities/103111515647012208243), but they are closing it down soon. Please use this [**GitHub repo**](https://github.com/trakt/api-help) for everything API related moving forward.
