## Code of Conduct: Navigating the Night

To ensure our midnight showing remains a haven for collaboration, let's all
abide by the following code of conduct:

- **Respect:** Treat all members of the community with the respect they deserve,
  regardless of their experience or background. We're all here to celebrate the
  art of cinema, like a diverse audience gathered in a darkened theater.
- **Constructive Criticism:** When providing feedback, focus on the code, not
  the coder. Offer suggestions that help improve the project, like a seasoned
  director guiding a young actor to a stellar performance.
- **Inclusivity:** Embrace diversity and inclusivity in all forms. Our project
  thrives on the unique perspectives and talents of its contributors, like a
  film enriched by a cast of varied and vibrant characters.

Thank you for joining us on this cinematic journey. Your contributions, whether
in code or in spirit, are what make trakt-lite a beacon in the night. Let's
create something extraordinary together.
