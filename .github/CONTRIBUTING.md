# Contributing to trakt-api: The Director's Cut

Welcome to trakt-api! This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to
this TypeScript API wrapper. By following these guidelines, you'll help us
maintain a robust and reliable interface for interacting with the Trakt.tv API
service.

## Bug Reports: The Mystery Unveiled

Found a bug in the API, a unexpected response, or a request that's not working
as documented? Report any issues by opening a new issue on the GitHub
repository. Please provide:

- A clear description of the problem
- The endpoint and HTTP method being used
- Request payload (if applicable)
- The actual vs expected response
- Any relevant error messages or status codes

The more technical details you provide, the faster we can investigate and
resolve the issue.

## Pull Requests: The Premiere

Ready to unveil your creation, your code that will redefine the trakt-lite
experience? Before you submit your pull request, ensure it adheres to the
following rules of the game:

- **Bug Fixes:** These are always welcome, like a skilled detective patching up
  a bullet-riddled case file. Submit your fix, and we'll review it with the
  utmost scrutiny.

## Code of Conduct: The Midnight Showing

To ensure our midnight showing remains a haven for collaboration, let's all
abide by the following code of conduct:

- **Respect:** Treat all members of the community with the respect they deserve,
  regardless of their experience or background. We're all here to celebrate the
  art of cinema, like a diverse audience gathered in a darkened theater.
- **Constructive Criticism:** When providing feedback, focus on the code, not
  the coder. Offer suggestions that help improve the project, like a seasoned
  director guiding a young actor to a stellar performance.
- **Inclusivity:** Embrace diversity and inclusivity in all forms. Our project
  thrives on the unique perspectives and talents of its contributors, like a
  film enriched by a cast of varied and vibrant characters.

Thank you for joining us on this cinematic journey. Your contributions, whether
in code or in spirit, are what make trakt-lite a beacon in the night. Let's
create something extraordinary together.
