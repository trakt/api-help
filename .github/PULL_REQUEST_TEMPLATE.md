## Scene Setting: A Clear Description

Begin with a concise and descriptive title that captures the essence of your
changes. Think of it as the film's tagline, enticing viewers to delve deeper. In
the description, provide a detailed account of the issue you're addressing or
the feature you're introducing. Be specific, my friend, like a screenwriter
meticulously crafting each scene. Explain the "why" behind your changes, the
motivations of your code, and the impact it will have on the trakt-lite
narrative.

## Testing: The Dress Rehearsal

Before the grand premiere, ensure your code has undergone rigorous testing.
Write unit tests that validate the functionality of your changes, ensuring they
perform flawlessly under the spotlight. Think of it as a dress rehearsal, where
every line of code is scrutinized and perfected before the final performance.

## Code Review: The Critic's Eye

Be prepared to address feedback from the project maintainers and other
contributors. Embrace their insights, for they are the seasoned critics of the
trakt-lite theater. Engage in constructive dialogue, refine your code based on
their suggestions, and together we'll ensure your contribution is a cinematic
masterpiece.

## Other Considerations:

- **Coding Standards:** Adhere to the project's coding standards, ensuring your
  code is as elegant as a film score and as readable as a well-written
  screenplay.
- **Commit Messages:** Craft clear and concise commit messages that explain the
  purpose of each change, like a director's notes guiding the audience through
  the film's narrative. We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/), so please follow this specification.
- **Documentation:** If your changes affect the documentation, update it
  accordingly, ensuring it remains as informative as a film encyclopedia.

## Conventional Commit Cheat-sheet:

- **feat:** A new feature
- **fix:** A bug fix
- **docs:** Documentation only changes
- **style:** Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor:** A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf:** A code change that improves performance
- **test:** Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore:** Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

By following these guidelines, you'll ensure your pull request is a cinematic
triumph, a contribution worthy of a place in the trakt-lite hall of fame. Now,
let the show begin!
