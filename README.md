## Project Structure

This [workspace](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/workspaces/)
contains multiple projects:

- **`api`:** The beating heart of our operation. This project defines the Trakt
  API interactions using `ts-rest` and `zod` for type-safe communication and
  validation. Think of it as our precinct's meticulously organized evidence
  board.
- **`playground`:** Our detective's sandbox. This CLI project allows for
  effortless exploration and experimentation with the Trakt API. It's where we
  test our hunches and follow the leads.
- **`swagger`:** The public notice board. A simple `hono` server that exposes
  the API contract as an OpenAPI/Swagger definition, providing clear
  documentation for those who wish to understand our methods.
